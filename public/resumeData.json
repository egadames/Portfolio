    "bio": "My name is Erik Adames and I am a Full Stack Web Developer. I have recently moved to the Bay Area after spending the prior 6 years in Switzerland. While abroad, I led large complex pricing projects involving various teams from around the world. After spending most of my career working in the transportation industry, I decided that a change was required. In 2017, I enrolled in graduate classes at the Harvard University Extension School to obtain a Certificate in Data Science. That was completed in 2019 and the following year I moved to Berkeley, California. To enhance my skillset, I enrolled at the Full Stack Web Developer bootcamp offered by University of California Berkeley which was completed in 2020. The bootcamp provided a deep understanding of a variety of computer languages as well as the principles and techniques of website construction and maintenance. My previous work experience help develop my dependable and superb work ethic.",

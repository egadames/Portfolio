    "bio": "My career began as a warehouse worker in Charlotte, NC. Due to my superb work ethic, my career progressed quickly from the warehouse in Charlotte to the global headquarters in Switzerland. When working, my focus is to be efficient which allows me to handle a large workload quickly and without errors. My last position was as a Global Project Pricing Analyst which required the managing of complex pricing projects. My projects were successful but over time an uneasy feeling starting to develop. I discovered that I wanted to work in a more dynamic and impactful field. This was the major influence that made me complete a graduate certificate in Data Science from Harvard University Extension school with the aim to work in a more technology-driven occupation. These courses reawaken my love of learning and motivated me to enhance my technical skillset further by completing a full stack web development Bootcamp. My work ethic naturally aligned with being a developer. The concept that each component is broken into small, efficient chunks that can be scaled and reused came naturally to me. This allowed me to excel in the Bootcamp. My previous work experience helped develop my dependable and superb work ethic. I am now positioned for a full-time employment opportunity and hope to hear from you soon.",

    "bio": "I began my career at a local branch of Kuehne and Nagel, which is a large global shipping company, and worked full time directly after graduating college. In this role, I was able to establish a strong professional relationship with customers and become effective at developing new customers or stabilizing very demanding and complex customer accounts.  
      In 2014, I was transferred from the local Charlotte, NC office to the global headquarters in Switzerland to lead large complex pricing projects.  These projects entailed a significant amount of analysis and access to various technological platforms. Due to this, I developed a passion for combining analysis and technology which in turn led me to enroll at the Harvard Extension School to obtain a graduate certificate in data science.
      In late 2018, I married my wife who is from Switzerland and we started preparing for our eventual move to the United States. My wife started receiving great offers to work in the Bay Area so this enabled me to pursue a career in a more technology-driven occupation that builds upon my strong background in analysis. To enhance my skill set, I also enrolled at the Full Stack Web Developer bootcamp offered by University of California Berkeley which was completed in 2020.  The bootcamp provided a deep understanding of a variety of computer languages as well as the principles of data structures, algorithms and object-oriented programming. My previous work experience helped develop my dependable and superb work ethic. I am now positioned for a full-time employment opportunity and hope to hear from you soon
